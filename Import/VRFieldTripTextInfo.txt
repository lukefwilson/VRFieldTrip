***Bacteria information***

Bacteria were among the first <br>
life forms to appear on Earth. <br>
There are typically a million <br>
bacterial cells in a millileter <br>
of fresh water. Pathogenic <br>
bacteria are a major cause of <br>
human disease, and bacterial <br>
infections may be treated with <br>
antibiotics. <br><br>

***Red Blood Cell Information ***

Red blood cells are the most <br> 
common type of blood cell and <br>
an organism's principal means <br> 
of delivering oxygen. They are <br>
rich in hemoglobin, which is <br>
responsible for the red color. <br>
There are about 2.4 million red <br>
blood cells produced per second <br>
in human adults.


***Platelet information***

Platelets are blood cells whose <br>
function is to stop bleeding <br>
by clumping and clogging blood <br>
vessel injuries. Platelets <br>
have no cell nucleus; they are <br>
fragments of cytoplasm that <br>
enter circulation from the bone <br>
marrow.


***Epithelial Tissue information***

Epithelial tissues line the <br>
cavities and surfaces of <br>
structures throughout the body. <br>
Functions of epithelia cells <br>
include secretion, selective <br>
absorption, protection, <br>
transcellular transport, and <br>
detection of sensation.


***White Blood Cell information***

White blood cells are the cells  <br>
of the immune system that are <br>
involved in protecting the body <br>
against both infectious disease <br>
and foreign invaders. These cells <br>
attack bacteria by tagging them <br>
with antibodies and then <br>
absorbing them.
